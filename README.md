Proofreading Scripts
====================

I wanted to make use of Matt Might's [proofreading scripts](http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/), but I'm on a Windows machine most of the time.

So I rewrote them in Ruby and customized the output a bit in a way that
makes it more useful for me. 

These are more or less finished, unless bugs turn up or I decide to add
another kind of proofreader to the existing three.
